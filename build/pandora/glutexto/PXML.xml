		Glutexto is a simple text editor I made for the gcw and other handhelds like the caanoo or wiz. In fact I don't think, that it is quite useful for the pandora as the input is optimized for devices without a real keyboard. However as I port my programs to all devices, you geht this, too. ;)
		It supports:
		  * Editing large files, you are only limited by your memory
		  * utf8 support if the font supports it
		  * line wrapping
		  * line numbering
		Pretty useful for small devices without keyboard, where you just want to change a config or similar. But as said, pretty useful for the pandora in fact. ^^
		The name is a pun of the German word of "Charmeleon", which is "Glutexo".
